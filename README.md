# wfc-utility
This is a simple utility for generating images with samples and wave function collapse.
May come up with a more clever name in the future when this thing is feature-complete.

Current version: a-2

Current features:

- Basic image generation with a single sample and wave function collapse.

Known issues:

- A general lack of features (I just started this thing two days ago).
- The WFC algorithm has a tendency to generate weird artifacts and orphan pixels, especially with more complicated features.

Planned features:

Multiple samples.
- Saving/exporting generated images.
- Basic canvas painting tools.
- Bitmap pattern-determined WFC (rather than just a random offset).
